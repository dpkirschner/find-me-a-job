Of course. Here is a plan broken down into concrete, incremental milestones.

This approach focuses on building a thin "vertical slice" of the application first, then progressively adding features. Each milestone results in a tangible, working piece of the system, making it easier to build and test.

---
### **Milestone 1: The Core Chat Loop**

**Goal:** Get a single, stateless agent running that you can chat with from a basic web UI. This proves the end-to-end connection from the browser to your local LLM.

**Key Tasks:**
1.  **Setup Ollama:** Install Ollama and pull the `llama3.1:8b` model.
2.  **Basic FastAPI Server:** Create a `server/app.py` with a single `/chat` endpoint. This endpoint will receive a user message.
3.  **Simple LangGraph Agent:** In `agents/graph.py`, create a basic graph for one agent (e.g., `researcher`). For now, it doesn't need any tools. It just takes the chat history and generates the next response using `ChatOllama`.
4.  **Minimal Next.js UI:** Create a `ui/` app with a single page. It should have a text input and a display area. When you send a message, it hits your `/chat` endpoint and displays the streamed response.

✅ **Outcome:** A web page where you can have a simple conversation with your local Llama 3 model. No memory, no tools, no database yet.



---
### **Milestone 2: Adding Persistence & State**

**Goal:** Give your agent memory. Conversations should now persist between page reloads.

**Key Tasks:**
1.  **Integrate SQLite:** Add an SQLite database (`memory/db.sqlite`).
2.  **Create Tables:** Define a simple `agents` table (to identify who is talking) and a `messages` table (with `agent_id`, `role`, `content`).
3.  **Update API:** Modify the `/chat` endpoint. Before calling LangGraph, it must load the message history for that agent from the database. After getting a response, it must save both the assistant's response and the user's message back to the database.
4.  **UI for Multiple Agents:** Update the UI to have simple tabs for 2-3 agents (e.g., "Researcher," "Writer"). Clicking a tab sets the `agent_id` for the chat session, so conversations are kept separate.

✅ **Outcome:** A tabbed chat interface where each agent has its own persistent conversation history stored in SQLite.

---
### **Milestone 3: The First Real Tool & Background Job**

**Goal:** Make an agent do something useful and time-consuming without freezing the UI. This introduces asynchronous tasks and vector memory.

**Key Tasks:**
1.  **Install Tools:** Add **Playwright** for web scraping and **ChromaDB** for vector storage (`pip install playwright chromadb`).
2.  **Create a Tool:** In `agents/tools.py`, create a `playwright_scrape` tool that takes a URL and returns the page's text content.
3.  **Implement Background Tasks:** Use FastAPI's built-in `BackgroundTasks`. Create a new endpoint like `/agents/{id}/execute-tool`. When called, it will run the scrape tool in the background.
4.  **Integrate ChromaDB:** After the scrape tool finishes, have it store the webpage content in ChromaDB, associated with the agent or conversation.
5.  **Modify Agent Graph:** Update the `researcher` agent's LangGraph to be able to decide when to call the `playwright_scrape` tool.

✅ **Outcome:** You can ask the `researcher` agent, "Research this page: [URL]," and it will start the job in the background. You can continue chatting while it works. A separate tool for querying the ChromaDB can be added to retrieve the information.

---
### **Milestone 4: The Application Dashboard**

**Goal:** Shift from an agent-centric view to an application-centric one. This is the core of the job-search functionality.

**Key Tasks:**
1.  **Evolve the Database:** Add the central `applications` table to your SQLite database. It should include fields like `company_name`, `job_title`, `status` ('identified', 'researching', 'applied'), etc.
2.  **Build the Dashboard UI:** Change the main page of your Next.js app to be a dashboard. This page should fetch from a new `/applications` endpoint and display all your job applications, perhaps as a list or a Kanban board.
3.  **Create the Orchestrator:** Implement the `orchestrator` agent. For this milestone, it doesn't need to delegate yet. Its main job is to manage the state of an application.
4.  **Link UI to State:** When you're on the dashboard, clicking an application should take you to a detailed view where you can chat with the `orchestrator` *in the context of that specific job application*.

✅ **Outcome:** A dashboard where you can add and track job applications. The system now revolves around a central goal rather than just conversations.



---
### **Milestone 5: True Multi-Agent Collaboration**

**Goal:** Make the agents work together, directed by the Orchestrator. This delivers on the "multi-agent system" promise.

**Key Tasks:**
1.  **Implement Delegation:** Build the mechanism for the `Orchestrator`'s graph to call the graphs of other agents (like `researcher` and `writer`). This is the most complex LangGraph logic you'll write.
2.  **Flesh out the `Writer` Agent:** Build the `writer` agent with its file I/O tools to read your base resume and write new tailored drafts.
3.  **Connect the Workflow:** Now, in the chat for a specific application, you can tell the Orchestrator: `"Research this company and then draft a cover letter."`
    * The `Orchestrator` should first delegate to the `researcher`.
    * Once the research is done and the notes are saved, it should delegate to the `writer`, providing it with the context from the research.

✅ **Outcome:** A truly collaborative system where you can give a high-level command and watch the agents work together to complete the multi-step task.

### **Milestone 6: Polish & Scale**

**Goal:** Harden the system, improve the user experience, and prepare it for more intensive use.

**Key Tasks:**
1.  **Upgrade to Celery & Redis:** (Optional, but impressive). Replace FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` with a full Celery and Redis setup. This gives you a dedicated worker pool, task retries, and better monitoring—a great feature for a portfolio project.
2.  **Add Final Agents:** Implement the `email_hunter` to automatically populate your application dashboard.
3.  **Refine UI/UX:** Add status indicators, progress bars for background jobs, notifications, and better error handling in the UI.
4.  **Improve Tooling:** Make your tools more robust. Add error handling to the web scraper, allow the writer to edit existing drafts, etc.

✅ **Outcome:** A polished, robust, and highly functional AI assistant that's a powerful job-searching tool and an outstanding portfolio project.
