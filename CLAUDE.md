# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is "find-me-a-job", an agent orchestrator designed to help with job searching activities. The repository is currently in its initial state with only basic project files.

## Repository Structure

This is a minimal repository containing:
- `README.md` - Basic project description
- `LICENSE` - MIT License
- This is a new project that appears to be in the planning/initial phase

## Development Setup

This repository does not yet contain any code, build configuration, or development dependencies. Future development will likely require setting up:
- Package management configuration (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Build and test scripts
- CI/CD configuration
- Source code structure

## Architecture Notes

The project is described as an "agent orchestrator" for job searching, suggesting it will likely involve:
- Agent-based architecture for different job search tasks
- Orchestration/coordination logic between multiple agents
- Integration with job search APIs and platforms
- Data processing and management capabilities

Since this is a greenfield project, architectural decisions are still to be made regarding technology stack, framework choices, and implementation approach.
